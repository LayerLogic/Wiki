**Trigger:** Start of a new project

**Performed by:** Project lead with the product owner

**Inputs:** User needs, system requirements, and risk control measures

**Tasks:**

1.  **Definitions**

    Add definitions for key terms and acronyms to the `data/definitions.yml` file. Standard and concise definitions can clarify team communication quite a bit, much like good data abstractions can simplify a software project.

2.  **Software Requirements**

    To the extent possible, major software requirements should be enumerated at the start of the project [[62304:5.2.1]].

    Write requirements, following the Requirements Analysis Activity.

    Software requirements are often categorized as one of the following types [[62304:5.2.2 and 62304:5.2.3]]. It should help one identify key requirements:

    a. Functional and capability requirements [[62304:5.2.2.a]]

        - performance (e.g., the purpose of the software and timing requirements),
        - physical characteristics (e.g., code language, platform, operating system),
        - computing environment (e.g., hardware, memory size, processing unit, time zone, network infrastructure) under which the software is to perform, and need for compatibility with upgrades or multiple SOUP or other device versions.

    b. Software system inputs and outputs [[62304:5.2.2.b]]

        - data characteristics (e.g., numerical, alpha-numeric, format) ranges, limits, and defaults.

    c. Interfaces between the software system and other systems [[62304:5.2.2.c]]

    d. Security requirements [[62304:5.2.2.e]]

        - those related to the compromise of sensitive information,
        - authentication,
        - authorization,
        - audit trail, and
        - communication integrity.

    e. Data definitions and database requirements [[62304:5.2.2.g]]

    f. Requirements related to methods of operation and maintenance [[62304:5.2.2.i]]

    g. Regulatory requirements [[62304:5.2.2.l]]
