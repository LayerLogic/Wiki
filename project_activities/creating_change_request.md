**Trigger:** Need to record a chunk of development work

**Performed by:** Anyone on the project

**Inputs:** User needs and requirements

**Tasks:**

1. **Write Change Request**

   There are many ways to divide requirements into change requests. Change requests that will be implemented in upcoming sprints should usually be made more granular, while change requests that may not be worked on for a while can be less granular.

   Since change requests may be split up later and detailed requirements are added in an agile fashion, this activity allows minimal detail to be added to the change request. Sometimes even a title is sufficient.

   Unless you're the project lead, don't assign the issue to a release. That will be handled during sprint planning. If, however, you know that the issue won't be tackled in any of the current releases, feel free to add it to the icebox GitHub milestone.
