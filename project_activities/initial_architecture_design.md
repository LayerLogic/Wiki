**Trigger:** Start of a new project

**Performed by:** Project lead with the engineering team

**Inputs:** Draft SDS

**Tasks:**

1. **Document Software Items**

   Develop an initial software system architecture and document it in the SDS [[62304:5.3.1]]. The SDS should describe how the software system is divided into a hierarchy of software items [[62304:5.4.1]]. The level of granularity should be higher depending on the risk.

   Following the Issue - Design Specifications activity, update the architectural diagrams and fill in parts of the SDS.

   The initial architecture does not need to be complete since code construction can guide architectural decisions. However, it is worth spending a significant amount of time on the initial architecture.

2. **Select Core Technologies**

   Following the [Adding Dependencies activity](../issue_activities/adding_dependecies.md), record details about the core technologies that will be used on the project. For example, the programing language, frameworks, compilers, etc.

**Outputs:** Draft SDS

**Verified by:** See issue-layer activities
